# fivem-ghost-replay
A simple example resource for saving and replaying vehicle "ghosts"

## Installation
1. Download or clone this repository into your FiveM resources folder.
2. Add `start fivem-ghost-replay` to your server.cfg file.
3. Restart your FiveM server.
## Usage
1. Enter a vehicle in-game.
2. Use the command `/ghostrecord start` to start recording your vehicle's movements.
3. Use the command `/ghostrecord stop` to stop recording. (You can provide a name for the recording: `/ghostrecord stop myGhost`)
4. Use the command `/ghostplay myGhost` to replay the recorded ghost.
5. There is no stop playback command as this is just supposed to be an example resource. You can modify the code to add that functionality if needed.
